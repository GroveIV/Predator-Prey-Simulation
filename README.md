# Predator-Prey-Simulation

This program simulates a predator and prey scenario where ants are the prey and doodlebugs are the predators.  This program uses
polymorphism, with the critter class as the parent and the ant and doodlebugs as the child classes which allows an array of 
critter pointers to instantiate each child class as needed.
